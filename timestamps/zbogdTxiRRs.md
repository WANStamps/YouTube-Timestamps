[0:00] Intro: why webcams, $30–$400 range, test plan
[1:06] Sponsor segment (couches)

[1:32] Budget segment ($20–$60): baseline pick + cheap 4K scams
  > 2:13 Logitech Brio 101 (recommended baseline)
  > 2:33 “4K” budget cam scam (fake 4K / no real detail gain)
  > 3:33 Anker C200 (low-light + super wide FOV, tends to overexpose)
  > 4:05 Nexigo N60 (punchy colors, good motion, fisheye 110°)
  > 4:39 Gusu G910 (1440p + ring light wild card)
  > 5:37 Nintendo Piranha Plant (480p novelty, do not buy)

[6:11] Mid-range segment: fewer novelty cams, more serious options
  > 6:23 Elgato Facecam Mk.II (HDR/60fps, no autofocus)
  > 6:46 OBSBOT Meet 2 (4K AI framing + AF + HDR, best so far)
  > 7:16 EMEET Nova IS-4K AF (needs tweaking, fixed via software)
  > 7:44 EMEET Pico (similar, less tweaking, fast AF)
  > 9:04 EMEET Pixy (gimbal PTZ follow, “in-between” deal)

[9:36] Premium segment: “big dogs” and highest-end picks
  > 9:40 Logitech MX Brio (simple, strong OOTB, fewer extras)
  > 10:05 OBSBOT Tiny 2 Lite (gimbal tracking + gesture zoom)
  > 10:31 Insta360 Link 2 (favorite here, best tracking/skin tones)
  > 11:24 Elgato Facecam 4K (4K60, lens filters, otherwise less standout)
  > 12:25 Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra (top image quality, pricey, fewer extras)

[13:15] Final rankings + buying advice (winners shift after price reveal)
[14:20] Practical notes: USB port limits, multi-cam tips, links + samples
[15:05] Sponsor segment reprise (couches)
