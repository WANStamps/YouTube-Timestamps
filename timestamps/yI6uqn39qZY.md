[0:00] Intro: AC hot takes are back after a year; lots happened; can’t cover all submissions.
[0:48] Hot take #1 (R520 Junior): Only Jacob can realistically “hide in plain sight”.
   > 1:12 The Hidden One agrees: Jacob’s outfit fits the era; hoods/robes make others stand out.
[1:43] Hot take #2 (Arturo Lombre): Black Flag is overrated; people only like ship combat.
   > 1:50 The Hidden One disagrees: naval combat is split; Edward Kenway, story, and characters carry it.
[2:37] Hot take #3 (Saskuke): Without Yasuke, Shadows’ story would be 10x worse.
   > 2:45 The Hidden One agrees: Yasuke carries the story; backlash unfairly targeted him; dual protagonists likely weakened writing.
[3:24] Hot take #4 (Jackson): Old combat (AC1–Syndicate) is better than Origins–Shadows.
   > 3:43 The Hidden One disagrees on depth: old combat often boiled down to counter = win.
   > 4:21 Newer combat demands spacing, parries, dodges, abilities, enemy variety.
   > 4:52 The Hidden One concedes: old combat had better finishers, disarming, grabs; wants a Unity-style middle ground.
[5:22] Hot take #5 (Rhino): Basim is the only interesting thing since Revelations.
   > 5:30 The Hidden One strongly disagrees: dismisses many highlights post-Revelations; Valhalla Basim interesting, Mirage Basim bland.
[6:33] Hot take #6 (Hush): AC needs more character sequels, fewer gameplay resets.
   > 6:40 The Hidden One agrees: wants continuity, modern-day throughlines, returning characters.
   > 7:10 Wants sequels for Bayek, Edward Kenway, Arno.
[7:19] Hot take #7 (Alexis): Brotherhood overrated; nostalgia-carried; poor parkour/map; weak story without Ezio.
   > 7:46 The Hidden One partly agrees: weakest Ezio-trilogy narrative; pacing issues.
   > 7:59 Disagrees on parkour: calls it a skill issue; cities complement the system.
[8:14] Hot take #8 (Hans Snow): Early WWI is perfect for a full AC game.
   > 8:21 The Hidden One agrees conceptually; cites Syndicate WWI and Unity WWII sequences.
   > 8:50 Doubts current Ubisoft can handle it; mentions canceled post–Civil War project.
[9:09] Hot take #9 (Marty Baron): AC will be remembered as wasted potential held back by Ubisoft.
   > 9:17 The Hidden One agrees: endless historical potential; other studios might do more with the IP.
[10:06] Hot take #10 (Miguel): Valhalla has the best modern day since AC3.
   > 10:10 The Hidden One agrees: Black Flag/Rogue weak; Odyssey decent; Valhalla strong; Mirage/Shadows lack modern day.
[10:46] Hot take #11 (Khaled): Orlog in Valhalla was great.
   > 10:49 The Hidden One didn’t play it; no strong opinion.
[10:55] Hot take #12 (Adam Moss): Aya should’ve been the main protagonist of Origins.
   > 11:00 The Hidden One disagrees: Bayek is great; Aya deserved DLC, not main role.
[11:30] Hot take #13 (Enrique): Assassin’s Creed has never been amazing, just decent.
   > 11:35 The Hidden One mostly agrees: budgets huge, quality inconsistent; lore keeps him invested.
[12:51] Hot take #14 (Welsh Gamer): Shadows’ modern day works conceptually as near-future dystopia.
   > 13:03 The Hidden One strongly disagrees: watching AI talk is unengaging; only likes Animus hub idea.
[13:22] Hot take #15 (Adam): RPG-era AC games are better overall than phase 1.
   > 13:35 The Hidden One mixed: newer games better mechanically; older games far superior in story and writing.
[14:15] Hot take #16 (Luga): Mirage DLC could make it a top-five AC game.
   > 14:26 The Hidden One skeptical: DLC can’t fix weak base story; hopeful for better DLC writing and parkour.
[15:13] Hot take #17 (Sad): Basim is the true successor to Ezio.
   > 15:15 The Hidden One hard no.
[15:22] Hot take #18 (Indiana Jones himself): Writing since Unity feels soulless.
   > 15:28 The Hidden One agrees: studio rotation, loss of writing talent, RPG shift hurt storytelling.
[16:41] Hot take #19 (Farhan): Past and modern day should directly affect each other again.
   > 16:59 The Hidden One fully agrees: early AC nailed this; wants meaningful present-day payoff back.
[17:41] Hot take #20 (Cosmic): Ezio is overrated; three games set unrealistic expectations.
   > 17:49 The Hidden One rejects take: three games exist because Ezio earned them.
[17:58] Hot take #21 (Matland PKC): Shadows has the best stealth in the series.
   > 18:11 The Hidden One agrees on core stealth; wishes for social stealth and denser cities.
[18:54] Hot take #22 (Partisan): Arno is the saddest protagonist.
   > 18:56 The Hidden One debates: compares Arno, Connor, Bayek, Kassandra; leans Bayek/Kassandra.
[19:40] Hot take #23 (PK): Altair is loved mostly because of Revelations.
   > 19:45 The Hidden One partly agrees: AC1 redemption arc crucial; Revelations cemented his legacy.
[20:20] Hot take #24 (Empty Muppet): Connor is good; hated because he wasn’t Ezio.
   > 20:29 The Hidden One agrees after replay: homestead missions reveal his depth.
[21:21] Hot take #25 (Unbangon19): AC fans are impossible to please.
   > 21:35 The Hidden One agrees: divided fanbase is Ubisoft’s own making.
[22:14] Hot take #26 (Subscribe to the Hidden One): You should subscribe to the Hidden One.
   > 22:18 The Hidden One agrees.
