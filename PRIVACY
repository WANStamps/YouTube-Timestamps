# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Usage

The YouTube WAN Show Timestamps extension:
- Does not collect any personal data
- Does not track user behavior
- Does not store any information locally
- Does not share any data with third parties

The only external data interaction is fetching timestamp data from GitHub's public API for the video you are currently watching.

## GitHub API Usage
When you watch a YouTube video, the extension:
1. Checks if timestamp data exists for that video
2. If it exists, fetches the timestamp data from our public GitHub repository
3. Displays these timestamps alongside your video

No information about you or your viewing habits is sent to GitHub or anywhere else.

## Updates
If our data handling practices change, we will update this privacy policy accordingly.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can open an issue on our GitHub repository.
